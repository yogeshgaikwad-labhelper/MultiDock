# MultiDock
MultiDock 2.1 is easy molecular docking and screening tool which uses AutoDock Vina 1.2.3 in the background. Some of the features are,

    We can make personal ligand database or import from other sources.
    Multiple protein receptor and multiple ligand can be docked on single click.
    Reverse docking
    Rigid receptor and Flexible receptor docking options
    Blind dock and specific site docking
    Ligand strucure viewer
    Fragmented ligand docking
    Export the molecules in pdb or mol files. Combine receptor+ligand files for further analysis.
    Refine the results on the basis of on-target and off-target ligands.
    Calculations of Ki and LE.
    ADME properties of ligands.

Requirements:

    Autodock Vina 1.2.3
    MGL Tools 1.5.7 Or ADFR 1.0
    Openbabel 2.4.1
    Python 3.10 or later for meeko
